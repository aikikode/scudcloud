# ScudCloud - Linux Client for Slack

![ScudCloud Logo](/scudcloud-1.0/resources/scudcloud.png?raw=true "Scud clouds are low, ragged and wind-torn cloud fragments, usually not attached to the thunderstorm base. With the 'mother' cloud, the form of them together is like a chat balloon")

ScudCloud is a **non official** open-source Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Mint, Arch, Fedora) desktop client for [Slack&copy;](http://slack.com).

ScudCloud uses the [QT](http://qt-project.org) library + [Webkit](http://www.webkit.org/) to render the web version of Slack, but using the [QWebkit-Native bridge](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtwebkit-bridge.html) to improve desktop integration with:

* multiple teams support,
* native system notifications,
* count of unread direct mentions at launcher/sytray icon,
* alert/wobbling on new messages,
* channels quicklist (Unity only),
* optional "Close to Tray".

# Install

## Ubuntu/Kubuntu, Mint and Debian

Please, first update your system with a `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`. If not, ScudCloud will crash with some old components.

Then, to install it under **Ubuntu/Kubuntu** (14.04, 14.10, 15.04), **Mint** and **Debian**, open a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:

```term
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/scudcloud
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install scudcloud
```

If you want **spell checking** (it'll only mark wrong words in red, but no suggestions), add the `hunspell` dictionary for your language. For `en-us`:

    sudo apt-get install hunspell-en-us

If you want to use a Slack icon instead of ScudCloud (which is not possible to include in this package due to copyright), download [any 128px Slack icon](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=slack+icon&tbm=isch&source=lnt&tbs=isz:ex,iszw:128,iszh:128) to your home folder saving as `scudcloud.png` and run:

```term
sudo dpkg-divert --add --rename --divert /opt/scudcloud/resources/scudcloud.png.real /opt/scudcloud/resources/scudcloud.png
sudo cp ~/scudcloud.png /opt/scudcloud/resources/
sudo chmod +r /opt/scudcloud/resources/scudcloud.png # ensure it's globally readable
```

## Ubuntu 12.04

For Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), **additionally** you'll need to update `qtwebkit`: Slack is not compatible with `libqtwebkit4` package shipped with 12.04, hanging in the `Loading` screen. Please add the following PPAs (for updated `qtwebkit`):

```term
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:immerrr-k/qtwebkit4-backport
sudo apt-get update
```

## Arch Linux

There is a [PKGBUILD available][pkgbuild] on the Arch User Repository. You can install it
using whichever AUR method you use. For instance, if you use cower:

```term
cower -d scudcloud
cd scudcloud
makepkg -si
```

[pkgbuild]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/scudcloud/

## Fedora 21

There is a yum repository available for Fedora 21. All you need to do is follow [these instructions][build_suse].

[build_suse]: http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Amoonwolf%3Ascudcloud&package=scudcloud

## Manual Install

The manual install is intended for not supported distros (if you want to contribute with a package for your distro, you're welcome!).

First, you'll need to install at least packages for `python3`, `python-qt4` (`qt4` for `python3`) and `python-dbus` (`dbus` library for `python3`).

Then run the below script: it'll download the code and install it:

```bash
wget https://github.com/raelgc/scudcloud/archive/v1.0.52.tar.gz
tar -xvf v1.0.52.tar.gz
cd scudcloud-1.0.52
SOURCE="scudcloud-1.0"
INSTALL="/opt/scudcloud"
sudo mkdir -p $INSTALL/lib
sudo mkdir -p $INSTALL/resources
sudo cp $SOURCE/lib/*.py $INSTALL/lib
sudo cp $SOURCE/resources/* $INSTALL/resources
sudo cp $SOURCE/scudcloud $INSTALL
sudo cp $SOURCE/LICENSE $INSTALL
sudo cp $SOURCE/scudcloud.desktop /usr/share/applications
sudo cp $SOURCE/systray/hicolor/* /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps
sudo cp $SOURCE/systray/mono-dark/* /usr/share/icons/mono-dark/scalable/apps
sudo cp $SOURCE/systray/mono-light/* /usr/share/icons/mono-light/scalable/apps
sudo ln -sf $INSTALL/scudcloud /usr/bin/scudcloud
```

# Troubleshooting

## 1. Default domain

You can change the default domain editing or just deleting the config file:

    ~/.config/scudcloud/scudcloud.cfg

## 2. Where is the package for my distro?

If not listed above, you're welcome [to contribute](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 3. `Keep me signed in` is not working

For some reason, ScudCloud was not able to create the configuration folder. Please, manually create this folder:

    ~/.config/scudcloud/

## 4. How to disable Flash?

Flash is required to display embedded videos, but if you don't care, disable it starting with:

    scudcloud --no_plugins=True
    
## 5. How to start ScudCloud minimized?

You can start ScudCloud minized to tray with:

    scudcloud --minimized=True

## 6. High DPI Support

ScudCloud offers zoom support. The zoom level will be persisted between sessions.

- Increase zoom pressing `Ctrl`+`+` (usually fired with `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`=`);
- Decrease with `Ctrl`+`-`;
- Reset it with `Ctrl`+`0`.
